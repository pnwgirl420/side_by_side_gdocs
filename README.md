# side_by_side_gdocs

A Chrome extension to toggle a side-by-side view in Google Docs.

The app adds a small icon to Google Docs that allows toggling between a side-by-side view and normal view:

## Known issues:

- Editing does not work well when side-by-side view is engaged.
- Sometimes the text for the second page will not display until you scroll.
- 1632 or greater resolution is required (width-wise). The plugin detects this and will not add the toggle button on incompatible resolutions. <https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/side_by_side_gdocs/issues/1>
